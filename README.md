# randgame
A game randomizer, currently featuring 3 popular games!


----DISCLAIMER----
This program is being produced by myself, someone who is learning Python as we speak. There isn't a UI, and you do have to run the program every single time you want a new game/combination. This program will be updated regularly, with new games and new additions to current games. Stay tuned!


Have you ever wanted to really spice up a game? Maybe grabbing the same guns in Apex Legends is starting to bore you, or you're indecisive on who you want to play in Civ 6. Well, RandGame is for you! With just the simple input of a number, RandGame will randomly produce a way to play!
